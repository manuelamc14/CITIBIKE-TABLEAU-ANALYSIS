# City Bike - Jersey City

CityBike is a company that offers a cheap way of transportation around the city,  with the aid of 15,000 bikes and over 1,000 stations. Due to the number of users, the company has implemented a system to collect data published on its website every month. 

This analysis is based on information from January 2020 to December 2020 in Jersey City.

Jersey city had available 53 stations to provide service to the users during 2020. Based on their location, most of these stations are located in five high-income zip code areas.

According to the data, the top five stations were used to start trips. Grove St Path, Newport Pkwy, Liberty Light Rail, Hamilton Park, and Sip Ave. These stations had something in common; they are located closer to other public transportation stations such as train stations, bus stations, and main avenues.
 

This analysis pretends to expose two phenomena that the data reveals:


**-  A significant portion of the “Customers” users type are tourists; meanwhile, the “Subscribers” are residents of the city.**

Three variables of the data were analyzed to explain this phenomenon:
Number of trips by weekday
Trip start time
Trip duration 

For 2020, more than 336,000 trips were made in Jersey City. Subscribers made 68.78% of the trips; meanwhile, Customers made only 31.22%. 

The majority of the subscribers’ trips were made on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, having a constant increase during these days. However, there is a decrease in the trip numbers from Tuesday until Sunday. 

Another factor in the trip schedule for subscribers is the trip start time. There are two peaks, one at 8:00 am and the other at 6:00 pm.  During this time, there is a decrease between 8:00 and 10:00 am in the number of trips. However, after 10:00 am, the trend increases and then drops again after the day’s last peak. 

Regarding the trip duration, since it is an outdoor activity, it is highly affected by the weather. During extreme temperatures season’s as winter and summer, the trip lasts between 11 and 15 minutes. Meanwhile, during spring, the average reaches 20 minutes.  

On the other hand,  the customer’s trip numbers trend increases during the whole week,  starting on Monday and reaching its peak on Saturday and Sunday. The start time follows the same pattern; it has a constant growth from 5:00 am to 6:00 pm, where 6:00 pm is the busiest hour. The trips decrease after that time.

Regarding the trip duration, the Customers are affected in the same way as Subscribers. They took longer trips during spring, around 50 minutes.  Meanwhile, in summer and winter, the trips last approximately  20 and 40 minutes. 

In conclusion, the variables above allow creating a general profile for the Subscriber and Customers Users possible. A Subscriber is a person who uses the bikes during the week to go straight to places, like their home or job. This conclusion is based on the trip time and the start trip time. In the Customer's case is a person who uses the bikes mainly during the weekend and uses it to go around several places and explore the city, according to the trip duration time.  

**-  There is no lead age group that sets the flow in the trends in the Subscribers group.**

The range of age in the subscriber’s group is wide. The youngest person is under 15 while the older person is over the ’80s. For a better analysis, the users were split into age groups. The subscribers’ most prominent age groups are 25 to 35 years old in Females and Male. These groups represent more than 60% of the Subscribers population. 

The difference among the age groups in the trip duration is slightly different. The 15-year-old users are the ones who spent more time with the bikes, around 18 minutes on  average. Meanwhile, the 65-year-old users only tend to spend about 11 minutes on their trips.

As mentioned before, the weather is a variable with a high impact on the user’s behavior. This situation also reflects in the growth of the group’s population during the year. For the second quarter of the year, 41% of the age groups increase the population while the other 59% decrease their population compared to the first quarter of the year.  However, for the rest of the year, all the groups behaved in the same way. For the third quarter, due to warmer temperatures, all groups had an increase in their population. And as expected, for the last quarter of the year, the population’s growth was negative for all the groups. 

The last part of this analysis pretended to visualize the age groups’ distribution in the top 5 start stations. Although the age groups between 25 and 35 represented 60% of the population, they do not have a significant representation in the stations. 

In conclusion, no lead age group set the trend in the different patterns of this data since all the groups tend to behave in the same way. The differences are not significant.
